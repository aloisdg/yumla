Current version is working. Do what you want with it.

## Synopsis

yumla is a client for [yuml.me](http://www.yuml.me).
With yumla, you can write a small script and generate a clean handwriting-like UML.
If you are looking for a complete version, you should look to the [wandernauta's project](https://github.com/wandernauta/yuml) about it.

## Motivation

I love yUML. Pocketworks made a great job with this tool.
I made yumla only because I want to use it directly from my shell.
I also made it because I was looking for some training in shell script.

## Installation

Download the script. Run it with. Enjoy your UML.
